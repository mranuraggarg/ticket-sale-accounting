# ticket sale accounting

## Introduction
I have been part of the planetarium community since 1999. Later in 2006 I joined Nehru Planetarium, Delhi, India as a Planetarium Educator, and my relation with the planetarium even stronger. Although I left that post in 2009 for my further studies, but it is still my second home. In 2013, planetarium accountant came up with an idea that there should be a better way to calculate the daily OCCUPANCY STATEMENT, as he use to struggle a lot with it due to digital divide. Listening to his complains I started with this project. 

## About the software
This is my first ever graphical project, and since I was using Linux full time, I choose GTK+3 as my graphic toolkit. Although I was using Fortran at that time, but I wanted to explore Python more, and hence used that on the backend.

## Working
It was supposed to be a simple accounting software to calculate the total daily sale for Planetarium, as it was intended to be use by a person with limited computer based capabilities. So, I kept the layout as simple and as close to Excel as possible. It do only two primary tasks:
- Calculate the total sale
- Save the results as a HTML file.

## Conclusion
Being my first ever graphic based project and I was extremely new in Python, I would consider it to be pretty good. It does the intended task easily and it is extremely easy to port between Linux, Windows and MacOS.

Said that, it is still in its extremely crude form, as I never updated it after its initial deployment. Still, few of the upgrades I would like to work on are:
- Bifurcating the code into functions.
- Saving data to SQL (or any-other database)
- Saving result in a PDF rather then HTML, for better porting.
- Taking direct print from the software.

These are just the few which I would like to start with and then see where it goes.
